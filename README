This is the README file for ExtUtils::AutoInstall, a module to
let Makefile.PL automatically install dependencies via CPAN or
CPANPLUS.

Most notable features include:

- Letting the user enable/disable optional dependencies.
- Support sane defaults by probing for the machine's capability.
- If not inside a cpan shell, use CPAN.pm to install dependencies.
- Enable/disable the associated tests automatically.
- Supply UNINST=1 when it is safe and possibly needed.
- Checks MANIFEST to avoid unneccessary grepping of EXE_FILES.
- Utilizes CPANPLUS where feasible.
- Offers check-only and skip-all Makefile.PL targets.
- Offers check-only and install-only Makefile targets.

* Installation

ExtUtils::AutoInstall uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
